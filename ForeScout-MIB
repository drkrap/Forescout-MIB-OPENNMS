This alarm clears all alarms for this managed object that have the same Alarm type, Probable cause and Specific problems (if given). Indeterminate (assigned value = 2): Indicates that the severity level cannot be determined. Critical (assigned value = 3): Indicates that a service affecting condition has occurred and an immediate corrective action is required. Such a severity can be reported, for example, when a managed object becomes totally out of service and its capability must be restored. Major (assigned value = 4): Indicates that a service affecting condition has developed and an urgent corrective action is required. Such a severity can be reported, for example, when there is a severe degradation in the capability of the managed object and its full capability must be restored. Minor (assigned value = 5): Indicates the existence of a non-service affecting fault condition and that corrective action should be taken in order to prevent a more serious (for example, service affecting) fault. Such a severity can be reported, for example, when the detected alarm condition is not currently degrading the capacity of the managed object. Warning (assigned value = 6): Indicates the detection of a potential or impending service affecting fault, before any significant effects have been felt. Action should be taken to further diagnose (if necessary) and correct the problem in order to prevent it from becoming a more serious service affecting fault. Informational (assigned value = 7): Provided for informational purposes only.
